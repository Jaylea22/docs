## Overview

Branch links can be used together with **[Facebook](http://facebook.com/)**  ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app. Refer to [Facebook's Ad Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide){:target="\_blank"} to learn more.

Facebook's Ad Platform supports numerous campaign types and a shared set of advertisement formats. To help you navigate Facebook's Advertisement Platform we created this guide detailing how to use Branch links in all major Facebook ad types.

## Data Mapping between Branch and Facebook

### Event Names

!!! info "Standard vs Custom Events"
	Please follow the [Tracking Commerce, Content, Lifecycle and Custom Events](/apps/v2event/) guide when implementing event tracking in the Branch SDK.  When tracking any of the Facebook events that are mapped to the Branch `custom` event, use the event name from the table below; e.g. `branch.logevent('AdClick')`.

Currently Facebook appears to only support sending one fb_content_id (etc) per event, whereas Branch allows you to send many. To provide as much functionality as possible, we choose the first content_item and search it for key-value pairs that can be sent to Facebook.

## Viewing Facebook Data

{! ingredients/deep-linked-ads/reporting-dimensions-sans.md !}
